			<h3>About Todd</h3>
			<p>After graduating college with a degree in business, I worked as an accountant, earning my CPA. I eventually
			went to graduate school and subsequently worked as an accounting professor. As an accounting professor, I engaged in accounting
			research through programming with the SAS language. I found the coding aspect of my job to be the most enjoyable! So, I decided it is
			time to really develop my coding muscles and I joined Thinkful.
			</p>
			<p>As a student at Thinkful, I've begun my journey and honing my coding skills!</p>
			<p>If you're looking to hire a new developer (or want to collaborate me on an awesome project) please reach out! I am so excited to 
			work with other developers to build great software.
